They form the foundation of many quantum protocols and are represented as superpositions of computational basis states. Our implementation uses Hadamard and CNOT gates to create this entanglement, resulting in a quantum state where measuring one qubit instantly determines the state of the other.",
                "Entanglement Properties": "The entanglement in Bell states demonstrates non-local quantum correlations that Einstein called 'spooky action at a distance.' When measured, the two qubits always show correlated results regardless of the distance between them. This quantum entanglement is a resource that powers many quantum information protocols.",

Our implementation demonstrates this with a 3-qubit system searching for a specific marked state.",
                "Search Space Analysis": "The current implementation searches through 2^3=8 possible states, targeting the state '101'. The oracle marks this state with a phase flip, and the diffusion operator amplifies its amplitude. In larger search spaces, Grover's algorithm would show even more dramatic advantages over classical search.",

Our implementation focuses on the quantum Fourier transform component which is central to the algorithm's exponential speedup.",

This transformation is crucial for extracting the periodicity information needed for factoring large numbers.",
                "Period Finding": "The algorithm finds the period of a modular exponentiation function, which is directly related to the factors of a number. The quantum advantage comes from the QFT's ability to extract periodic information exponentially faster than classical algorithms.",
